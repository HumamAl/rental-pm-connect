Connecting short-term rental owners with the right PM company is a matching problem — the platform needs structured lead intake, a scoring algorithm that weighs location, property type, and capacity, and dashboards that give both sides visibility into the pipeline.

**Here's a working demo:** https://rental-pm-connect.vercel.app

It includes a lead intake pipeline, PM company directory with verification, a multi-factor matching engine with compatibility scores, and a notification feed. Built in Next.js with clean module separation between leads, matching, and notifications — ready to wire into a real database and API layer.

My Lead Intake CRM and Fleet Maintenance SaaS projects follow this same pattern: multi-entity platforms with dashboards, scoring logic, and operational workflows.

Happy to walk through the demo on a quick call.
